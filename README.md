This is a full-stack Mobile Store Web Application developed to simulate a real-world online mobile shop experience. The project is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) and demonstrates complete CRUD operations, API development, and frontend-backend integration. Users can view mobile products dynamically loaded from the database, add or remove items from their cart, and submit messages through a contact form. The cart and contact functionalities are fully connected to the backend and database, ensuring real-time data handling. An admin-facing "Add Product" form allows new products to be stored in the database and displayed on the frontend. A custom search API enables users to filter products directly from the database. A payment form UI is also included for future integration. This project showcases practical full-stack development skills, including API handling, database operations, and dynamic React UI
